outsourcing


It was my first project ordered by other person.
The codes are not that difficult, but the progress I took until deploying my project was so complicated.
I searched all articles in stackoverflow and netlify community, and I asked to other people I know..

Surprisingly, the issue was finding "my error".
Computer was just saying where the problem was.!!

So I successfully deployed in website by using NETLIFY
